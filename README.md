# US Airports Web Map
This repository contains the two geojson files. One is the airports.geojson, which contains all the airports in the United States. The other is the us-states.geojson, which contains all the states' boundaries of the United States. The interactive web map shows the distribution of airports in the US. The map has shown the number of airports in each state, the larger the number of airports, the darker the color of the state. The map also demonstrates whether the airport has an air traffic control tower or not, if the airport has an air traffic control tower, it will display in green, otherwise, it will be red.
